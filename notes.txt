- Command Lookup
Bash determines how to execute the command:
    Functions: Checks if it's a shell function.
    Built-ins: Checks if it's a Bash built-in (e.g., cd, echo).
    Executables: Searches for the command in directories listed in the PATH environment variable.


- Redirection Setup
If the command involves redirection (>, <, >>, 2>, etc.), Bash sets up the necessary file descriptors.


- Execution
Bash executes the command:
    For built-ins and functions, it runs them directly.
    For external commands, Bash creates a child process and uses exec() to execute the program.
